    "#### Introduction to Modeling in Sedaro\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sedaro, Branches most fundamentally define Templates - either an Agent Template or a Scenario Template. These Templates then define reusable, instantiatable definitions for an Agent or Scenario as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent:** An actor within a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario:** Defines the simulation, including the involved Agents and which Templates define them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Template:** Captures the model for a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario Template:** Captures the instantiation of differentiated Agents, the resolution of their abstract \"Targets\", and the configuration of the simulation clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates are defined in SedaroML. **SedaroML** is a modeling language for defining system properties and structure as normalized, interrelated, and hierarchical blocks of attributes. SedaroML is JSON-based and is designed to be easily human and machine readable/writeable.  This includes model interpretation, traversal, etc. The SedaroML model with all meta attributes is called a `Metamodel`.  A template `Metamodel` is located under the `data` key of a Repository's Branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some specific concepts in SedaroML that are important to understand:\n",
    "  - **Attributes:** Individual properties of a Block (e.g., `mass`, `voltage`, etc.) captured as a key-value pair.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Root:** The `root` refers to the highest level key/value pairs of the JSON-object of SedaroML. The keys are attributes, just like on `block`s, but `root` is not a `block` itself. All `Metamodel`s contain `blocks` and `index` attributes in `root` which store and help with querying for all `block`s in the `Metamodel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Blocks:** A `block` is a set of Attributes, including a `type` which defines the type of the `block` (e.g., `ReactionWheel`, `Battery`, etc.). All `block`s are located under the `blocks` attribute of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Hierarchy:** The `block`s in a SedaroML model have hierarchy such that a `block` `type` can extend one or more `block` `type`s (e.g., a `ReactionWheel` is a specialized `Actuator` and an `Actuator` is a specialized `Component`). The hierarchy of a model can be interpreted using the `index` and `_supers` meta attributes of a `Metamodel`.  `index` provides a lookup to traverse from a `block` `type` to its sub-`block` `type`s, ultimately down to the individual `block` instances in the model. `_supers` provides a lookup to traverse from a `block` `type` to its super-`block` `type`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Relationships:** The model Root and its Blocks can be related to one another using Relationship Attributes.  The `_relationships` meta attribute provides a lookup from `block` `type` to its relationships Attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Quantity Kinds:** In SedaroML, an Attribute that has a value and a unit is called a \"Quantity\". Quantities may be composed of other Quantities, called Compound Quantities. A category of Quantities that share the same unit system is called a \"Quantity Kind\".  If a model Attribute is an explicit Quantity, it will be included in the `_quantityKinds` meta attribute lookup.  Attributes that are Explicit Quantity Kinds may be defined in any of the supported units for the Quantity Kind. For example, all angle Attributes in SedaroML may be defined in either degrees or radians. If the unit isn't provided, the default unit for the given Quantity Kind is assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "SedaroML is used to define both AgentTemplates and Scenario models, with Scenario models referencing AgentTemplate Branches (and therefore their models) via the `templateRef` attribute of an `Agent` Block.\n"

    "##### Time-Variable Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Sedaro Results API, a SedaroML model can be fetched for a given Agent at a given timestamp.  To generate this model, each stream for that Agent is searched for the value at the given timestamp.  If the exact timestamp does not exist in the series, the most immediate previous value is used (also known as the value \"last observed carried forward\").\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Differentiating Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `differentiateState` to differentiate an Agent in a Scenario, pass a complete or subset SedaroML model.  This model will be merged with the Agent Template model, with the differentiating model taking precedence.  This allows for an Agent to be defined with a Template, and then differentiated with specific attributes. Or in the case of Rolling Simulations, a new simulation can be created using the complete state of an Agent from a prior simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve the rolling simulations use case, these modeling principles will be leveraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** It is often confusing to discuss \"time\" with regards to simulations.  Here, \"wall time\" refers to the actual, real-world time and \"simulation time\" refers to time in the simulation.  For example, we could run a simulation for 24-hours of simulation time, and it take 20-minutes of wall time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The rolling simulations approach is as follows:**\n",
    "1. Given an existing Scenario and associated Agent Templates, start a simulation where the simulation start time is the current wall time and set it to run for a fixed amount of simulation time into the future (e.g., 2-hours).\n",
    "1. Fetch the results of the simulation periodically, as the simulation progresses, and extract specific state frames at the current wall time as simulated telemetry.\n",
    "1. As real telemetry is collected during a downlink, save the full state of the Agent at the timestamp of the real telemetry (by accessing the time-variable MetaModel from the Results API) and then merge the telemetry into the MetaModel to override any telemetry-defined state.\n",
    "1. Replace the current simulation with a new simulation that starts from the telemetry timestamp and that uses the telemetry-informed MetaModel as the initial state of Agent. This is done via `Agent.differentiateState`.\n",
