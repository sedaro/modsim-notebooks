    "# Introduction  \n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the new Studies support added to Sedaro. \n",
    "The core of this support is the new API python client object **SimStudy**.\n",
    "**SimStudy** will generate and run a series of *SimJobs* in parallel up to account capacity limits. The remaining simjobs will be placed in a queue and will be execute when resources are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each *SimJob* of a **SimStudy** will set the random seed to a different value in order to generate different output results from the simulation.\n",
    "The **Overrides** feature takes this a step further by providing a means to adjust any starting value of any model of the simulation using a set of pre-defined functions. In other words, each *SimJob* of a **SimStudy** will run a baseline Scenario branch with model parameters variations in order to observe their effects on performance results."

They provide a high pointing accuracy,[1]: 362  and are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star.\n",

The magnetorquer creates a magnetic dipole that interfaces with an ambient magnetic field, usually Earth's, so that the counter-forces produced provide useful torque.\n",
