    "In Sedaro, *cosimulation* refers to the ablity of a running simulation to interact with hardware, software, and other simulations outside Sedaro. This is achieved through the creation of cosimulation [blocks](https://docs.sedaro.com/KeyConcepts/blocks), which use the query language to specify a set of consumed and produced values for a given cosimulation interface.\n",

    "Each cosimulation interface is either *per-round*, meaning it consumes simulation data and produces a new output at every timestep, or *spontaneous*, meaning that it can produce and consume state at any time. If the simulator state depends on data provided by a per-round cosimulation interface, the simulation will block until the cosimulator returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spontaneous cosimulation is recommended for real-time simulations. Produced spontaneous state is timestamped, and will affect the simulation at the round at or immediately following the timestamp. Spontaneous state production is also unique in that it is not required to ever provide a value and can remain optionally unused during a simulation. In this case, the simulation will continue to consume the initial value for the state until a new value is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cosimulation interface is independent meaning some may be Per Round while others are Spontaneous. This also means that individual cosimulators can consume/produce state simultaneously over different interfaces."
