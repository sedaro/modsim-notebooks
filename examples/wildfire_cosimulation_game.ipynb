    "You will need to update some of the string values below in your `config.json` file. Get the branch ID for the Wildfire scenario that you would like this notebook to target and input the ID as the Wildfire `SCENARIO_BRANCH_ID` variable. The `WILDFIRE_ID` string below should not require changing, but if you run into problems you may need to check this value to verify that it matches the agent ID of Wildfire in the targeted scenario. The `HOST` and `WEB_HOST` variables should only require updating if you are running a separate, specialized instance of the Sedaro software.\n",
