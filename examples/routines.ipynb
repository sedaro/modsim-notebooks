    "## Routines\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Sedaro 4.9, the internal logic of agents was mostly driven by operational modes. These provided significant utility, but they also had limitations, such as the inability to have two operational modes active simultaneously or to drive the selection of the active operational mode with logic other than conditions and priority. Since the release of 4.9, the functionality of `OperationalMode` has been replaced by `Routine`, which allows for much more comprehensive, complicated, and customizable behavior for agents in Sedaro. Routines are similar to operational modes in that they are used to drive important behavioral logic like active modes and interfaces, but they come in different types that each have their own functionality.\n",

    "- [`Routine`](#generic-routine): the generic `Routine` block\n",
    "- [`CombinationalLogic`](#combinationallogic-routines): A specialized `Routine` block that is associated with various prioritized `LogicalConfiguration` options and re-creates the functionality of operational modes\n",
    "- [`Schedule`](#schedule-routines): A specialized `Routine` block with a list of subroutines and times that determines when each subroutine will be active\n",
    "- [`FiniteStateMachine`](#finitestatemachine-routines): A specialized `Routine` block that is associated with `StateTransition` blocks for transitions between subroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Routine` Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- A specialized `Routine` chooses between its `subroutines`.\n",
    "- A set of associated routines with a common ancestor (which itself does not have any parent routines) is called a \"program\".\n",

    "\n",
    "- A specialized `Routine` can have at most one active subroutine.\n",
    "- Otherwise, more than one `Routine` can be active at a time.\n",
    "- Some behaviors are controlled by the combination of active `Routine`s within a single program. For example, since only one pointing mode can be active at a time, only one `Routine` program may control the agent's active pointing mode.\n"
